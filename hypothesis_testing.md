## H1: Return rates are the same for Mobile vs Desktop
- Test: Chi-square test on contingency table (Device Ã— Returned)
- Result: <<stat, p-value>>
- Interpretation: <<accept/reject H0>>

## H2: Discount % does not affect Quantity sold
- Test: Correlation and simple regression check
- Result: <<coef, p-value>>
- Interpretation: <<accept/reject H0>>

## H3: Younger (18â€“25) vs older groups have same return rate
- Test: Chi-square (AgeGroup Ã— Returned)
- Result: <<stat, p-value>>
- Interpretation: <<accept/reject H0>>

## H4: Delivery performance consistent across regions
- Test: Chi-square (Region Ã— DeliveryStatus)
- Result: <<stat, p-value>>
- Interpretation: <<accept/reject H0>>

## H5: Brand does not influence return probability
- Test: Chi-square (Brand Ã— Returned) [filter to top brands]
- Result: <<stat, p-value>>
